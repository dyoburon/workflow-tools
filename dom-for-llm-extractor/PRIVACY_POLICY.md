# Privacy Policy - DOM Extractor for LLMs

**Last updated: January 8, 2026**

## Overview

DOM Extractor for LLMs is a browser extension that helps developers extract structured DOM information from web pages. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles your data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.**

This extension:
- Does NOT collect personal information
- Does NOT track browsing history
- Does NOT send data to external servers
- Does NOT use analytics or telemetry
- Does NOT store any information about visited websites

## How It Works

The extension operates entirely on your local machine:

1. When activated, it analyzes DOM elements on the current page
2. Extracted information is copied directly to your clipboard
3. No data leaves your browser

## Permissions Explained

- **activeTab**: Required to read DOM elements on the current page when you activate the extension
- **clipboardWrite**: Required to copy extracted data to your clipboard
- **storage**: Used only to remember your last extraction (stored locally in your browser)

## Data Storage

The only data stored is:
- Your last extraction metadata (mode used, element count, timestamp)
- This is stored locally in Chrome's extension storage
- It never leaves your device

## Third Parties
